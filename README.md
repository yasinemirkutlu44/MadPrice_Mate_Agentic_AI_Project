**MadPrice Mate** is an autonomous, agentic deal-discovery system built to identify compelling online bargains and notify users in real time. It predicts the price of an online product from its description and determines whether the deal qualifies as a bargain.

The platform uses an ensemble agent architecture combining **GPT-5.2** with **a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 model trained using QLoRA**, enabling robust reasoning alongside domain-adapted price inference. To improve grounding and reduce uncertainty, MadPrice Mate uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to retrieve relevant context and deliver accurate price estimation from a given product description, supporting more reliable discount assessment and bargain validation. Multiple specialised agents, including an ensemble agent and a deal-scanning agent, are **orchestrated** to scan for opportunities, evaluate them, and fetch the best bargains. When a bargain is detected, the system automatically sends a time-sensitive mobile push notification via Pushover, ensuring users receive actionable alerts without delay.
To run the project, please execute **MadPrice_Mate.py**. The **Demo_Files** folder contains the demo materials, including a video demonstration and a mobile notification screenshot, are located in the **Demo_Files** folder.
